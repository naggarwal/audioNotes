Current implementation is for summerizing meeting notes. I would like to have a ability to create notes for different types of transcriptions. one for Lectures and/or interviews. The json type would be different for those.


###PLAN

# Task ID: 1
# Title: Analysis of Current Implementation
# Status: Not Started
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: High
# Description: Analyze the current meeting notes summarization system
# Details:
- Review current code structure and architecture
- Identify components handling JSON parsing and summarization
- Document the current JSON schema for meeting notes
- Identify interface points where new transcription types can be integrated
- Determine shared functionality vs. type-specific processing

# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define JSON Schemas for New Transcription Types
# Status: Not Started
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: High
# Description: Create JSON schemas for lecture and interview transcriptions
# Details:
- Define lecture transcription JSON schema (consider features like timestamps, speaker identification, topic segmentation)
- Define interview transcription JSON schema (consider features like Q&A format, speaker roles, follow-up questions)
- Document differences between meeting, lecture, and interview schemas
- Identify common fields across all transcription types
- Create sample JSON files for each type

# Test Strategy:
- Review schemas with stakeholders
- Validate sample JSONs against defined schemas

# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design Transcription Type Abstraction
# Status: Not Started
# Dependencies: 1, 2
